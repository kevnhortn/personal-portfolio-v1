	Personal Portfolio Website v1	
</h1>

<h4 align="left">The first iteration of my <a href="https://kevinhorton.dev">kevinhorton.dev</a> built with HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. As one of my favorite projects, this personal portfolio website lends itself to a beautifully simple design, characterized by an intentional layout. It is responsive and rich in personal taste seen in the color scheme and typography selection.</h4>
